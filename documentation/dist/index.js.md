Certainly! As soon as you provide me with the source code of an application or library, I will begin documenting it in Markdown format. The documentation will cover aspects such as the purpose of the code, its functionality, usage examples, configurations, and any other relevant information that a developer might need to understand and work with the codebase effectively.

Please provide the first file or set of files for which you require documentation, and specify any particular details you would like to be included or emphasized within the documentation.

# Index Module Documentation

The index module serves as the main entry point for a web application that generates and manages interactive mazes. This module is responsible for setting up the user interface, binding maze-related functions to DOM events, and integrating 3D rendering capabilities using BabylonJS.

## Import Statements

The module begins by importing the necessary components:

- CSS styles for the page.
- Maze-related components (`Maze`, `AStarSolver`, MazeGame`) from corresponding modules.
- Different maze generation strategies from the `generators` module.
- The BabylonJS engine for 3D rendering.

## Maze UI Generation Function

### `generateMazeUI` Function Signature

```javascript
function generateMazeUI(
  mazeName, 
  generatorFunction, 
  cellsPerRow, 
  rows,
  use3D=false,
  drawFiddleHeads=false, 
  strokeStyle,
  allowDiagonal=false
)
```

Creates and sets up the user interface for a maze game along with its functionalities.

### Parameters

- `mazeName`: Name of the maze to be displayed in the UI.
- `generatorFunction`: The specific maze generation algorithm to use.
- `cellsPerRow`: Number of cells in each row of the maze.
- `rows`: Number of rows in the maze.
- `use3D` (optional): A flag to enable 3D rendering using BabylonJS.
- `drawFiddleHeads` (optional): Flag to enable decorative fiddleheads on maze walls.
- `strokeStyle` (optional): The color of the stroke for drawing the maze.
- `allowDiagonal` (optional): Boolean indicating if diagonal movement is allowed in the maze.

### Description

This function generates HTML elements for the maze UI, initializes instances of `Maze`, `AStarSolver`, and `MazeGame`, and binds them with respective input and button events. For 3D rendering, it inserts additional HTML elements and sets up a BabylonJS engine and scene.

## `onPlayerCollision` Event Callback

### Signature

```javascript
let onPlayerCollision = (player, wallDirection, playerIndex) => { /*...*/ }
```

### Description

Defines a collision handler that is invoked when a player collides with a maze wall. The handler triggers a "shake" animation on the canvas to visually indicate the collision.

## Maze UI Examples

Seven distinct calls to `generateMazeUI` create seven different mazes, using the premade generator functions and various settings for 3D usage, wall decorations (fiddleheads), and stroke style.

## Event Listeners

Two event listeners are set up to handle key events and apply them to the `MazeGame`:

- `keydown`: Calls `MazeGame.keyDownHandler` when a key is pressed.
- `keyup`: Calls `MazeGame.keyUpHandler` when a key is released.

## BabylonJS 3D Setup Function

### `setupBabylonJS` Function Signature

```javascript
async function setupBabylonJS(maze, canvasId, fpsdivId, genbuttonId) { /*...*/ }
```

### Parameters

- `maze`: An instance of `Maze` class for which the 3D scene will be created.
- `canvasId`: The ID of the HTML canvas element for BabylonJS rendering.
- `fpsdivId`: The ID of the element where FPS will be displayed.
- `genbuttonId`: The ID of the generate button to reset the BabylonJS scene when pressed.

### Description

This asynchronous function initializes BabylonJS, creates a new scene, camera, lighting, floor tiles, and walls based on the maze data. It provides a smooth rendering experience by disposing of the old scene and creating a new one whenever the user requests a new maze configuration.

## Example Usage

The maze UIs are generated for various maze generation algorithms, each with its own settings, which can include:

- Default 2D canvas rendering or optional 3D rendering with BabylonJS.
- Standard rectilinear mazes or octagonal mazes with diagonal paths.
- Custom color schemes for the maze rendering.

Finally, the documentation outlines how the main logic operates, handles the interactions, and how the 3D maze representation is managed using BabylonJS. The structure of this documentation allows a developer to understand the maze application's entry point and provides guidance for adding new mazes or modifying existing functionalities.

# A* Search Solver Module Documentation

The A* Search Solver module provides functionality for pathfinding within a maze using the A* algorithm. This algorithm combines features of Dijkstra's algorithm (which focuses on ensuring the shortest path) with the Greedy Best-First-Search (which prioritizes reaching the goal as quickly as possible), striking a balance between the two.

## AStarSolver Class

```javascript
export class AStarSolver {
  constructor(maze);
  solve(...);
  stepSolver(openSet, closedSet, allowDiagonal, rules, maxWaitTicks);
  initializeCell(cell, gValue);
  applyRules(maze, rules, current, neighbor, f, g, currentWaitTick);
  reconstructPath(end, waits);
  reset(multiagent);
  solveMultiple(goals, allowDiagonal, maxWaitTicks);
  initializeCellMulti(cell, gValue, key);
  heuristicGrid(cell1, cell2);
  heuristicDiag(cell1, cell2);
  drawPath(context, size);
  playMove(pathIdx, playerIndex, context, size, strokeColor, onGoalReached, drawPath, drawPlayerPath);
  playMoves(interval, playerIndex, context, size, strokeColor, onGoalReached, drawPath, drawPlayerPath);
  stopMoves();
  drawAStarProgress(context, size, strokeStyle);
  runAStarProgressAnimation(context, size, strokeStyle, stepDelayMs, startX, startY, endX, endY, allowDiagonal, rules, maxWaitTicks);
}
```

### Constructor

- `constructor(maze)`: Accepts a `Maze` instance required for solving.

### Methods

- `solve(...)`: Solves the maze using the A* algorithm from given start to end positions.
- `stepSolver(...)`: Executes a single step of the A* algorithm.
- `initializeCell(cell, gValue)`: Initializes maze cells with default values required for solving.
- `applyRules(...)`: Applies given rule constraints during the A* search.
- `reconstructPath(end, waits)`: Recreates the path from the end cell to the start cell.
- `reset(multiagent)`: Resets the internal state of the solver.
- `solveMultiple(goals, allowDiagonal, maxWaitTicks)`: Solves the maze for multiple agents with distinct start and end goals.
- `initializeCellMulti(cell, gValue, key)`: Initializes cells for multiagent pathfinding.
- `heuristicGrid(cell1, cell2)`: A grid-based heuristic function, such as the Manhattan Distance.
- `heuristicDiag(cell1, cell2)`: A diagonal movement heuristic function, using Euclidean Distance.
- `drawPath(context, size)`: Visualizes the path on a given context.
- `playMove(...)`: Animates a single move of the solution.
- `playMoves(...)`: Animates the full solution path.
- `stopMoves()`: Stops the animation of the solution path.
- `drawAStarProgress(...)`: Visualizes the progress of the A* algorithm.
- `runAStarProgressAnimation(...)`: Animates the A* search with a delay between steps to visualize the algorithm's progress.

## PriorityQueue Class

```javascript
class PriorityQueue {
  constructor();
  push(element, priority);
  pop();
  update(element, newPriority);
  reset();
  isEmpty();
  /* Private helper methods */
  bubbleUp(n);
  sinkDown(n);
}
```

### Description

A utility class used within the `AStarSolver` representing a priority queue with a binary heap. This queue is fundamental for the A* algorithm as it orders nodes (cells) by their costs (priorities), thereby ensuring that the next most promising node is chosen first.

## Example Usage

```javascript
const maze = new Maze(width, height, generateMazeFunction, onWin, seed, allowDiagonal);
const aStarSolver = new AStarSolver(maze);

const path = aStarSolver.solve(); // Solve the maze and get the path
aStarSolver.drawPath(context, size); // Visualize the path
aStarSolver.playMoves(500, playerIndex, context, size, strokeColor); // Animate the path at an interval of 500ms
```

The A* Search Solver module is designed to work intimately with the Maze class, leveraging its structure to navigate the maze and to apply a strategic search to find the optimal path from start to end. Additionally, the multiagent solving functionality allows for more complex scenarios where multiple entities traverse the maze with their goals and constraints.
